# ✈️ Airplane Crash Clustering Project

This project explores unsupervised clustering on historical airplane crash data from 1908 to the present. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and includes various features such as crash date, location, operator, fatalities, and more.

## 📊 Objective
To identify potential patterns or groupings in airplane crashes using clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Airplane Crashes since 1908](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908)
- **File**: `Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv`

## 📌 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection)
- Feature engineering (encoding dates, extracting fatality ratios, etc.)
- Clustering with KMeans
  

## 🛠 Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
